# Designing for AI: The Rise of Agentic Interfaces

We are witnessing a fundamental shift in computing. For 40 years, the paradigm has been "Point and Click." We are now moving to "Describe and Refine." Generative AI is not just a feature; it's a new runtime.

Designing for AI requires a complete rethink of traditional UI patterns. How do you design an interface where the output is not deterministic?

## The Command Bar Revolution

Typing is the new clicking. Command bars (CMD+K) are moving from a developer utility to the primary navigation center for all users.
Instead of clicking "File > Export > PDF > Options...", a user simply types "Send this as a PDF to Sarah."

<FeatureBox title="AI Interface Pattern">
- **Natural Language Input**: "Show me sales from last week" instead of manually applying 4 filters.
- **Generative Output**: "Draft a reply to this email" instead of a blank text box.
- **Context Awareness**: The AI knows what you are looking at. "Summarize this page" implies it has read the current state.
</FeatureBox>

## Designing for Uncertainty

Traditional software is binary: It works or it errors. AI output is probabilistic. It might be 90% correct.

**UI Principles for AI:**
1.  **Confidence Indicators**: Use visual cues to show how "sure" the AI is.
2.  **Easy Undo/Refine**: If the AI generates an image that is slightly off, allow the user to tweak it, not just regenerate from scratch.
3.  **Streaming UI**: AI is slow. Don't show a spinner for 10 seconds. Stream the text word-by-word. This keeps the user engaged and makes the system feel faster.

```tsx
// Example: Streaming text response component
function AIResponse({ stream }) {
  return (
    <div className="prose max-w-none">
      <Markdown>{stream.text}</Markdown>
      {stream.isActive && (
        <span className="inline-block w-2 h-4 bg-blue-500 animate-pulse ml-1" />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Prompt Engineering for UI

As developers, we need to ensure the AI returns structured data that our UI can render. We don't want a paragraph of text; we want a JSON object.

**Technique: One-Shot Prompting**
Feed the AI an example of the desired output format in the system prompt.
>"You are a UI generator. Return only valid JSON. Example: `{ type: 'button', label: 'Submit' }`."

## Ethical Considerations: The "Human in the Loop"

<Callout type="warning">
**Trust is fragile.** If your AI agent hallucinates and deletes a file without asking, you will lose that user forever.
</Callout>

Always distinguish between **Low Stakes** (Spotify playlist generation) and **High Stakes** (Banking transactions). High stakes actions must always require explicit human confirmation.

## Conclusion

The role of the designer is shifting. We are no longer designing static screens; we are designing *systems*, *guardrails*, and *conversations*. It's a Wild West, and "The Ladder" is building the tools to navigate it safely and effectively.

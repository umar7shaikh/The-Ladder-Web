# Welcome to Our First Blog Post

This is a sample blog post written in MDX format.

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, export metadata, and write JSX alongside your markdown.

### Features:
- Write markdown naturally
- Use React components
- Full TypeScript support
- Fast static generation

## Getting Started

To add a new blog post, simply create a new `.mdx` file in the `content/blog/` directory with the proper frontmatter.

```javascript
console.log("Hello from code block!");
